# Nalapani - In Progress

## A Simple 3D role playing game based on Nepal's history of Anglo-Nepal War. Focused mainly on the battle of Nalapani
The project is a simple Unity 3D project that follows the player through the events that occured during the battle of Nalapani

What does our Game Have?

Well it's still in progress but we have managed to include following

* Real-Life like Terrain

The terrain is taken from real-life elevation data and implemented into Unity using heightmaps.

* Characters (Balbhadra Kunwar for Now)

For now Balbhadra Kunwar has been implemented into the game, it was a long and hard process as it was our first character

The character design is first made (Its made in photoshop and its the best I could do :/)

The model somehow ended up being a little similar to the drawing (did cost like 5 days)
